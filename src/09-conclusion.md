## Conclusion

Deep Learning gives us the ability to analyze the contents of rich media, and,
for the first time, gain insight into what is actually inside of those objects.
We are just at the beginning of understanding how this set of techniques will be
useful, and the results are already impressive. We can scan a social network and
show you where people are disproportionately taking photos of oceans or
mountains, look at your genomics or radiology data and make cheap and better
healthcare recommendations, and find that photo of Aunt Margaret that you scanned in
from a shoebox with one simple query.

We are more optimistic for the future development of Deep Learning than for any
other form of machine learning. While this report specifically explores image
analysis, we will soon see these techniques applied in other areas, and we
believe this text provides a sound introduction to the principles necessary to
understand and utilize modern neural networks.

In this report we have explored the history and mathematical foundations of the
field, along with current applications and a survey of companies and open-source products
that are in the market today. We've also speculated about what the near future
holds. In the longer term, the ability for an algorithm to do feature
engineering without the assistance of an engineer has the potential to change
the way we build data processing systems. Even if image object analysis is
irrelevant to your interests, this underlying change in how we conceive and
engineer algorithms will impact your work.

In our prototypes, Pictograph and Fathom, we have demonstrated the utility of
current image analysis techniques on a corpus of social photo data. This is
interesting because the data is interesting -- we are gaining new insight into
human behavior through the lens of our collective desire to take smartphone
photographs -- but it is also a strong demonstration of the merits and
challenges of these algorithmic techniques: we know if you've taken a photo of a
Beagle puppy, but we don't yet know if you were sad while you were doing it.

We remain optimistic for the future of Deep Learning, not just for image
analysis, but for a variety of applications across industries. We expect to see
this technique used for many more applications in a variety of industries over
the next couple of years, and to see more breakthrough capabilities emerge
from this research in the years beyond that.
